# Kaitai definitions

Status: Experimental

Writing Golang structure for every one of the hundreds of frames simply wasn't
viable. Instead, this is an attempt to use a framework to generate them from
definitions derived from the standard.

These are Kaitai definitions of Fibre Channel frames.
This should allow usage from any supported langauge, and should be faster than
using e.g. reflection.
